# Bound Maker

Bound Maker is a StarCraft Brood War mapmaking utility for quickly mocking up bounding obstacles, written in C# WPF. It supports:

  - Simple tile-based terrain design (aesthetics only)
  - Location placement and name generation
  - Obstacle sequence building and previewing
  - Text trigger generation
  - Saving and loading creations


### Installation

Check Releases.

### Development

The vast majority of this code was haphazardly thrown together by a college student who had just started learning how to program way back in 2011. That said, it's gone through a hasty cleanup over the course of a weekend to get in a state where it can be uploaded to GitHub.

BoundMaker uses native WPF without any external libraries; getting started should be as simple as pulling down the repo and opening it in Visual Studio (or your preferred IDE). Pull requests for bug fixes, new features, maintenance, and/or testing are welcomed.

### Todos

 - Any sort of code coverage
 - Text trigger support for more editors?
